Inspired by the dark color of robes worn by Kapuzin friars of Austria in the 1700s, kapuziner was made with coffee, milk, sugar, and a swirl of whipped cream on top. What we now know as cappuccino, Perfect Daily Grind explains, was concocted by Italians in the 1900s for whom cappuccino was the ideal morning coffee that could be drunk in a handful of gulps for a quick jolt of caffeine.",
    "para_2": "While the exact method to making a cappuccino differs between leading coffee institutions of the world, Super Coffee writes that a 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk is generally followed in the U.S. That is, a cappuccino is usually one-third espresso and one-third steamed milk, followed by one-third of creamy milk foam on top. Per Daily Perfect Grind, when brewed by a skilled barista, the steamed milk and milk foam will form layers over the espresso instead of blending into it. The layers are the biggest giveaway that visibly distinguishes a cappuccino from other milk-based espresso coffees. This is also why a cappuccino usually tastes more intense than its milky counterparts and highlights the flavor of the coffee beans much better whilst giving a creamier mouthfeel.",

According to Bon Appétit. This makes cortado a very balanced coffee, only a small amount of milk allows the flavors of the espresso to shine without being too intense or milky. Traditionally, you will find a cortado served in a small metal or glass tumbler and it usually lacks any latte art on top. While most coffees come in different sizes, a cortado is a drink that is meant to be small, and so is almost always served in one standard size even at famous coffee chains.",

According to Bean & Bean Coffee, the cold brewing technique can be dated back to the 1600s when people in Kyoto, Japan, steeped tea in cold water.

Over time, the caffeine, oil, and sugar from the grounds seep into the water to produce a refreshing coffee that is smooth in taste. Hot water tends to bring out the acids from a coffee, making it astringent and often requiring milk to undercut the unpleasant flavor. Because cold brew is made without hot water, Bean & Bean writes that the drink is relatively low in acidity and milk added on top only makes the coffee smoother.

According to Business Insider, the American computing exec was trekking in the mountains of Tibet to learn a technique of meditation from Buddhist pilgrims in the area, when a woman served him an unusual brew: tea mixed with yak butter. The peculiar combination, as Asprey says via Business Insider, cleared the fog in his mind caused by altitude changes. In 2010, he came up with what we now know as bulletproof coffee — a blend that mixes coffee with grass-fed butter and his company's Brain Octane Oil.",
    "para_2": "Per the original recipe, the bulletproof coffee is made by blending one cup of brewed coffee with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the oil and another tablespoon or two of unsalted butter or ghee till it turns creamy. Though high in fat and calories, bulletproof coffee claims to be a low-carb meal replacement for breakfast, with enough calories for a morning energy kick whilst keeping hunger pangs at bay. It is a drink perfectly suited for the keto diet (via BBC GoodFood). While more research is needed to substantiate the claim, BBC GoodFood writes that one cup of bulletproof coffee packs in 242 to 354 kilocalories and contains more than the maximum daily recommended intake of saturated fats. Eating Well also finds that although you might want to drink the coffee for its creamy and foamy texture, it's best not to think of it as a meal replacement because it lacks protein and several other nutrients that are essential for your body.",

Quad shots use a specific amount of grounds and water — more than solo, doppio, or triple shots — and too much or too little of either will skew the taste of the espresso. Made correctly, an iced quad espresso will be bold and slightly sweet, with no bitterness or sourness. Quad shots can also be made hot if that is your preference, and if four shots are too much, the same drink can be made as a triple rather than a quad. ",

Traditionally, freddos are made with a specialty drink blender, which Zamanakis says is necessary for the best silky texture. The cappuccino variation follows the same method but adds a cap of frothy textured milk (an afrogala, as Greece calls it) over the top. If you're using specialty or high-quality beans and don't need sweetness in your coffee, the freddo can be made sans sugar to let the espresso taste shine. ",

Whereas drip coffee is milder in flavor and caffeine, Americanos are sweeter and punchier since the fast brewing time allows more of the natural flavor compounds to escape dissolving. In hot Americanos, the espresso shot is poured over a mug of hot water. This means the first sips are strongest in coffee taste and full of luscious crema for a smooth and full-bodied mouthfeel. The espresso will slowly melt into the water, and the beverage will get more diluted as you drink it, with the final drinks being the weakest.
